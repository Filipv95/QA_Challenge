Feature: Validate deposit address for correctness

  As a user of the faucet
  I want my deposit address to be validated for correctness

  Scenario: Validate deposit address format
    Given I am on the faucet's homepage
    And I want to enter my deposit address
    When I enter a deposit address in the designated field
    Then the faucet should validate the format of the deposit address
    And indicate whether the format is correct or incorrect

  Scenario: Display error for incorrect deposit address format
    Given I am on the faucet's homepage
    And I want to enter my deposit address
    When I enter an incorrectly formatted deposit address in the designated field
    Then the faucet should display an error message indicating an incorrect address format
    And prevent further interaction until a correctly formatted deposit address is provided

  Scenario: Validate deposit address integrity
    Given I am on the faucet's homepage
    And I want to enter my deposit address
    When I enter a deposit address in the designated field
    And click on the "Validate Address" button
    Then the faucet should validate the integrity of the deposit address
    And indicate whether the address is valid or invalid

  Scenario: Display error for invalid deposit address integrity
    Given I am on the faucet's homepage
    And I want to enter my deposit address
    When I enter an invalid deposit address in the designated field
    And click on the "Validate Address" button
    Then the faucet should display an error message indicating an invalid address integrity
    And prevent further interaction until a valid deposit address is provided

  Scenario: Compatibility and testing
    Given I am using a major browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
    When I access the faucet's homepage
    Then the faucet's deposit address validation functionality should work seamlessly
    And be compatible with different browsers and operating systems
