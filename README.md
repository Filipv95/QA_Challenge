<h1>QA Challenge</h1>

This repo contain solutions for QA Tech challenge tasks.

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>

Test an online factorial calculator website hosted on:
http://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/
You are free to explore the website and the calculator form in your search for the bugs and UX issues. 

Please document the test cases and any bugs that you find on the website.

Write a script or a program that will verify the correctness of the calculator for integer numbers in range (10, 100). You can do it in the language and framework of your choice.

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>

The testnet is an alternative blockchain to be used by the developers for testing, experimentation and integration. The testnet coins are distinct from the actual main network tokens and they hold no value. In case of most test blockchains the test tokens can be easily obtained from the online crypto faucets. Crypto faucets are websites that can distribute small amounts of test tokens to the interested users.

Please identify and write down some of the Acceptance Criteria for the official Avalanche crypto faucet available publicly under address https://faucet.avax.network/

Below you can find some of the example User Stories that you could write the Acceptance Criteria for. 
Feel free to not necessarily use all of the listed User Stories and to come up with your own:
 

- As a user of the faucet with Metamask account, I want to be able to connect my Metamask account to the faucet
- As a user of the faucet, I want to be able to receive test tokens without connecting my Metamask account to the faucet by simply entering my deposit address
- As a user of the faucet, I want my deposit address to be validated for correctness
- As an owner of the faucet, I want the numbers of the drops to be limited to 1 in 24hours


_In case you chose to include scenarios requiring Metamask access, for extra prudence we kindly ask you create a fresh Metamask account dedicated to this Exercise and refrain from using your personal Metamask account during this assignment._
